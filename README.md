# Repress WordPress Theme

Repress is a lightweight, magazine-style WordPress theme tailored for newsrooms and sport desks. It ships with dedicated post types for news and sport, a topics taxonomy for tagging coverage, and polished front-page/front-end templates.

## Features
- Custom post types for **News** and **Sport** articles
- Topics taxonomy shared across posts for flexible tagging
- Responsive hero layout highlighting breaking coverage
- Widget-ready sidebar and footer navigation support
- Editor styles matching the front-end palette

## Installation
1. Copy the `repress` directory into your WordPress installation under `wp-content/themes/`.
2. Activate **Repress** from the WordPress admin under **Appearance → Themes**.
3. Add content using the **News** and **Sport** post types, and organize with **Topics**.
4. Assign menus to the **Primary** and **Footer** locations and add widgets to the **Sidebar** to personalize the layout.

## Development notes
- Styles live in `style.css` alongside the theme header metadata.
- Templates are kept lean and use core WordPress functions to stay compatible with Gutenberg and classic editor workflows.
